## Introduction
* This Bot is designed to Encrypt and Decrypt the messages
* Encryption and Decryption process is done by Xor'ing a message and a key.
* Key is a integer value which is randomly ganerated from random function.
* Seed saves(remembers) the current value of randomly generated key in the process.
* During Encryption, each character of Input message is converted to its ascii value and xor'ed with key.
* appending every xor'ed word is appended and combined to one single word. Then it is coverted to hexadecimal for easy decryption. 
* So, Bot sends the encrypted message in hexadecimal format.
* During Decryption, hexadecimal string is coverted to normol string and then xor'ing each character of encrypted message and key gives decrypted message.

## Libraries
